// Telephone Words
// Each number key on a standard phone keypad has a set of Latin letters written on it as well: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Telephone-keypad2.svg

// Businesses often try to come up with clever ways to spell out their phone number in advertisements to make it more memorable. But there are a lot of combinations!

// Write a function that takes up to four digits of a phone number, and returns a list of all of the words that can be written on the phone with that number. (You should return all permutations, not only English words.)
